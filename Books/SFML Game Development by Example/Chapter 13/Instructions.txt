1. Run an instance of the Server 
2. Run an instance of the Client
3. Input the IP (127.0.0.1) and the Port provided
4. Run a second instance of the Client
5. Input the IP (127.0.0.1) and the Port provided (should be the same as the first one)
6. Enter some text in one of the Clients - it should appear in the other client
7. Input '!quit' on each Client to disconnect from the Server
8. Input '!quit' on the Server to end the session

Some caveats
1. There is no chat comms with the server - the server will not display what's happening between the two clients
2. There may be some firewall navigation to consider - proceed with caution in public
